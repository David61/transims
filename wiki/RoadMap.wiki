#summary TRANSIMS Road Map
TRANSIMS is an integrated set of tools developed to conduct regional transportation system analyses. Implementations follow three major phases. Click below to find out more about each phase:

The diagram illustrates the process. You may have a "Track 1" or "Track 2" implementation.  The "Track 1" implementation uses the left branch of the diagram.  It uses trip tables, the router and the microsimulator.  The "Track 2" implementation uses the right branch, and adds the activity-based components of TRANSIMS, such as the population synthesizer.
