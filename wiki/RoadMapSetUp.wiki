==Network Preparation==

Network preparation typically involves taking a network from an existing model, and converting it to a TRANSIMS network.  The two major sub-steps are highway network preparation and transit network preparation.  

===Highway Network Preparation:  Typical Process===

1. Starting data typically includes a list of nodes (with UTM coordinates) and a list of links (with origin / destination node, length, number of lanes in each direction, speed, capacity and other information).  Optional information includes a TRANSIMS shape file and turning restrictions.  If the initial data consists of ESRI shape files, [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/quickreference/GISNet%20QR.pdf GISNet] may be used to create TRANSIMS files. 

2. Before performing the network conversion, it is best to correct any errors in the input network.  Steps to consider include
  * Remove links and nodes that are not needed for the model.  These may include internal centroid connectors.  
  * Adding any new links or nodes that might be needed
  * Correcting the number of lanes and speeds on links
  * Correction of links with extremely short lengths. 
  * If a signalized divided arterial is represented as two one-way links, converting those links into two-way links and removing the extra nodes. This avoids the issue with two automatically-generated traffic signals extremely close together.  
  * Fixing erroneous shape information

3. TransimsNet ([http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/quickreference/TransimsNet%20QR.pdf QR], [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/usermanuals/TransimsNet%20v4.0.pdf Full])  is then used to perform the initial network conversion.  Required inputs include Nodes and Links.  Optional inputs include Zone, Turn Prohibition and Shape files.
