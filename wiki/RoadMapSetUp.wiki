#summary Setting Up the Model   [http://code.google.com/p/transims/w/RoadMap Back to Road Map]

=Network Preparation=

Network preparation typically involves taking a network from an existing model, and converting it to a TRANSIMS network.  The two major sub-steps are highway network preparation and transit network preparation.  

==Highway Network Preparation:  Typical Process==

1. Starting data typically includes a list of nodes (with UTM coordinates) and a list of links (with origin / destination node, length, number of lanes in each direction, speed, capacity and other information).  Optional information includes a TRANSIMS shape file and turning restrictions.  If the initial data consists of ESRI shape files, [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/quickreference/GISNet%20QR.pdf GISNet] may be used to create TRANSIMS files. 

2. Before performing the network conversion, it is best to correct any errors in the input network.  Steps to consider include
  * Remove links and nodes that are not needed for the model.  These may include internal centroid connectors.  
  * Adding any new links or nodes that might be needed
  * Correcting the number of lanes and speeds on links
  * Correction of links with extremely short lengths. 
  * If a signalized divided arterial is represented as two one-way links, converting those links into two-way links and removing the extra nodes. This avoids the issue with two automatically-generated traffic signals extremely close together.  
  * Fixing erroneous shape information

3. [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/quickreference/TransimsNet%20QR.pdf TransimsNet (QR)] [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/usermanuals/TransimsNet%20v4.0.pdf (Full)]  is then used to perform the initial network conversion.  Required inputs include Node and Link files.  Optional inputs include Zone, Turn Prohibition and Shape files. [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/usermanuals/Network%20Data%20Tables.pdf Network Data Tables] contains a list of all of the network tables, along with their fields. 

4. At this stage a number of other corrections are typically performed:
  *  Fixing any issues in the lane_connectivity file (particularly with multiple turn lanes)
  *  Modifying the sign and signal warrants as appropriate.
  *  Modifying activity locations    

5. [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/quickreference/IntControl%20QR.pdf IntControl (QR)]  [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/usermanuals/IntControl%20v2.2.pdf (Full)]
is then used to generate the files for the signalized intersections.  Inputs include Node, Link, Lane_Connectivity, Pocket_Lane, Actvity_Location, Sign_Warrant, and Signal_Warrant files. [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/usermanuals/Network%20Data%20Tables.pdf Network Data Tables] contains a list of all of the network tables, along with their fields. 

6.  Finally, [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/quickreference/ArcNet%20QR.pdf ArcNet (QR)] [http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/usermanuals/ArcNet%20v4.0.pdf (Full)] to generate shape files from the newly created TRANSIMS network.  These shape files are then loaded into a GIS, and the newly created network is examined for errors.
