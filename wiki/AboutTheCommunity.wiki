#summary About the TRANSIMS Online Community

The TRANSIMS Open Source Community is an independent and self-governing collaboration of TRANSIMS users, researchers and developers. A web-based infrastructure provides access to TRANSIMS core assets (software, data sets and documentation) and supports community interaction. Members collaborate by sharing code, enhanced documentation and proven data sets back into a public clearinghouse. 

The TRANSIMS Open Source Community was established in the Fall of 2006, with support from the [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)].  It has recently moved to this site and is being maintained by the [http://www.volpe.dot.gov Volpe Center] with continuing support from FHWA. For more information on the move, please click [FAQCommunityMove here].
