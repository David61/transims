# TRANSIMS Version 5 #

Version 5 of TRANSIMS is still under development.  It is recommended that you review the training materials and Execution Service first.

**[Training Materials](V5Training.md)** - Explanatory materials with a hands-on example

**Quick References** - In version 5, quick reference information is generated by running the program in question
with specified keys. For example, options for generating quick reference materials for TransimsNet include
the following.  In these cases, the use of a control file is optional.

| **Command**     | **Comment**    	|
|:----------------|:----------------|
| TransimsNet -H |  Shows program syntax and control |
| TransimsNet -C |  Create/update a self-documenting control file |
| TransimsNet -X |  Write an XML file with control keys |
| TransimsNet -R |  Write control keys and report names |

The **[Execution Service](http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/v5/trunk/documentation/usermanuals/ExecutionService_V5.0.pdf)**, written by AECOM, describes the syntax for running TRANSIMS programs.

The **[Program References](V5ProgramReferences.md)** describe each program.
The **[file](http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/v5/trunk/documentation/usermanuals/FileReference_V5.0_R0.8.pdf)** and **[parameter](http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/v5/trunk/documentation/usermanuals/ParameterReference_V5.0_R0.8.pdf)** references describe the files and parameters used by the programs.

The **[Highway Network How-To](http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/v5/trunk/documentation/howto/Highway_Network_How-To_V5.0_R1.0.pdf)** describes how to build a TRANSIMS highway network.

The **[User Equilibrium How-To](http://transims.googlecode.com/svn/v5/trunk/documentation/howto/User_Equilibrium_How_To_V5.0_R1.0.pdf)** describes user equilibrium

This is all a work in progress. The last update occurred on 9 September 2013.
