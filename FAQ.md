**1. The source code is still on SourceForge.  Why not move everything?**

Two reasons:  First, the downloads from SourceForge seem to be working well, although, in our opinion, the ancillary functions (forums, documentation and the like) are stronger in Google.   Therefore, the code downloads are being left on SourceForge.   The second reason concerns licensing.  TRANSIMS is released under the NASA Open Source Agreement, a license that is not currently supported by Google Code.  Therefore, the TRANSIMS code is remaining on SourceForge so that it can continue to be released under the NASA license.

**2.  Why the Apache license on Google?**

Apache is one of the open-source licenses that Google Code does support.  Since our code remains on SourceForge, the Apache license is primarily a placeholder.  However, the Apache license seems to have some features in common with the NASA license, including the requirement to identify modifications as such, an explicit patent clause, and the ability to link to code under a different license.

**3.  How do I post a question?**

Two ways:

1.	Log into the user group, http://groups.google.com/group/transims_ug, and post either a new discussion item, or a reply to an existing discussion item.

2.	Send an e-mail to [transims\_ug@googlegroups.com] .  The e-mail account from which you are sending your message must be a member of the group.  If you send an e-mail, you can include an attachment.

**4.  What should I bookmark?**

The following sites provides all of the key links; http://transims.googlecode.com or http://code.google.com/p/transims

If you participate in the users group, http://groups.google.com/group/transims_ug

**5.  What Internet browsers are best for this site?**

The site was developed for Internet Explorer 7.  However, we have tested it with Firefox, Internet Explorer 8, Safari and Chrome.   The site functions under all of these browsers, with some minor known issues:
  * Internet Explorer 8 - Improper line breaks on some pages.  Difficulty with photographic attachments.
  * Chrome - Some html documents show up as source code
  * Firefox - Some html documents show up as source code
  * Safari -
