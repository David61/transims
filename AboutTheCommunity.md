The TRANSIMS Open Source Community is an independent and self-governing collaboration of TRANSIMS users, researchers and developers. A web-based infrastructure provides access to TRANSIMS core assets (software, data sets and documentation) and supports community interaction. Members collaborate by sharing code, enhanced documentation and proven data sets back into a public clearinghouse.

The goals of the TRANSIMS open source project are:
  * To maintain public access to TRANSIMS core assets: TRANSIMS documentation, methods, source code and data sets are available to the public under a recognized open source license.
  * To provide an unbiased venue for information: Community members share problems, solutions, tools, and data. These interactions provide unbiased feedback on TRANSIMS core assets.
  * To support a connected community: The clearinghouse provides a single, centralized repository for all TRANSIMS-related materials. Community members use the clearinghouse not only to access the most recent materials, but also to post their own contributions, share their experiences, and elect leaders from within the community.
  * To maintain a nexus for further development: The community establishes procedures and infrastructure for transparently managing the core TRANSIMS assets. Interactions between users, developers, and researchers are facilitated. Contributions by community members are recognized, vetted, and published.

This is a community of volunteers. Individuals, not organizations, are community members. Community membership has no cost and participation is on a volunteer basis, that is, not remunerated by or through the community organization. The TRANSIMS open source community does not hold financial assets or distribute funding in any way to community members.

Achieving decision-making status within the community is based on the frequency and magnitude of an individual's contributions to the community. Observers are welcome, but they are excluded from community governance and will not have a voice in the management of community assets. Promotion or election to community leadership positions is informed by the weight of contribution made by an individual to the community over time.

The TRANSIMS Open Source Community was established in the Fall of 2006, with support from the [Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov).  Although the source code remains on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims), the online community has recently moved to this site and is being maintained by the [Volpe Center](http://www.volpe.dot.gov) with continuing support from FHWA.
